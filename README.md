## About

This Pacman project recreates the gameplay mechanics, known to all of you, according to its legacy arcade version.<br>
Players control the hungry yellow pacman and move through a maze to collect all the lost pizza crumbs from last nights,<br>
"staying awake to finish a project"-all-nighter.<br>
But be aware angry russian KGB agents are trying to silence the yellow headed-man.

This project is designed to get a better understanding of Javascript and Game-Design with a touch of <br>
nostalgic old-school feel.
